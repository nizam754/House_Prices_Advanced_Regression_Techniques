<br>
• The NumPy lib is fundamental for any kind of scientific computing with Python.
<br>
• pandas is a must-have tool for data analysis and manipulation.
<br>
• matplotlib is the most complete package in Python when it comes to data visualizations.
<br>
• seaborn is based on matplotlib as a higher-level set of visualization tools, not as powerful as matplotlib, but much easier to work with and delivers a lot with less work.
